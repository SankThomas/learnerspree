# Learn HTML5

In order to properly start the basics of web development and set a strong foundation, we are going to begin with everyone's favorite markup language.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the barebones of any website that you have interacted with on the internet. You can think of it as the skeleton.

It is important to note that HTML, being a markup language, does not behave the same way as other programming languages such as JavaScript; the major difference being that you cannot declare variables in HTML.

## Prerequisites

Before we can begin typing away, we need to get a few things out of the way:

1. Install a code editor to write your programs. I personally prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but you are free to use whatever code editor you are comfortable with such as Atom, Sublime Text, Webstorm or even Notepad.
2. If you don't have access to a code editor or you are unable to install one, then there are online code editors that work brilliantly even on mobile phones. However, if you are just beginning to learn how to code, I don't recommend that you start with an online code editor because they do a lot of things under the hood, which you can only learn when you are doing them yourself.

- Examples of online code editors are:
  1. [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
  2. [Codepen](https://codepen.io)
  3. [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
  4. [VsCode.dev](https://vscode.dev)
  5. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
  6. [JSBin](https://jsbin.com)

3. A passion to learn. Sometimes it's easy to begin something, but it can become hard to see it all the way through. I hope this documentation is easy to understand to help you through to the end.
