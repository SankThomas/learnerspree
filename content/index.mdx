# Welcome to Learnerspree

Learnerspree is an online educational platform where you can teach yourself how to code using examples and detailed explanations from instructors.

Currently, I am building modules for web development, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript and an additional ReactJs. More frameworks will be added soon.

## What Do You Want To Learn?

The following are the current modules available on the website.

## Collaborators

I am currently looking for collaborators or contributors who are willing to spend their time and energy to create documentations / modules / lessons for languages and frameworks that are currently not available on the website. For example:

1. Tailwind CSS
2. Angular JS
3. VueJs
4. PHP
5. Handlebars HTML Framework
6. Elixir
7. Python

## Vision

I would like for this website to become a one-stop-shop for as many topics as possible. Not just programming.
