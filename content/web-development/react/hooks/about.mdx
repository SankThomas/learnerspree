# About This Section

Hello everyone!

This module is designed to be a supplement to the eBook of the same name which you can get on my [Gumroad Catalogue](https://tsbsankara.gumroad.com).

It demonstrates all the React hooks, as well as a few other commonly used hooks from external libraries and from NextJs, with examples.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
### Step 1
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download) so that you are able to create new React applications and install packages (needed for when we get to hooks in external libraries)

### Install a code editor

So that you are able to write, test and debug the code examples herein.

### Basic knowledge of ReactJs

You should have some working knowledge of ReactJs such as how to create a React application, how to run the development server, file naming conventions, how to render elements to the UI, and concepts such as conditional rendering.

### Useful Information

Check out the [useHooks website](https://usehooks.com/) when you need to get some functionality running in your application and you don't want to build it from scratch. Of course, only check this out when you are comfortable working with hooks so that you're not completely blank.

Also, this website is very useful because it is all about custom hooks. So, once you get past that chapter, you can check it out again in order to better understand how to create your own custom hooks.

</Steps>

### Disclaimer:

All code that you are able to copy is working code. All code that you are not able to copy is code that won't work and is for demonstration purposes only. However, you can modify it so that it works. I have tested all the examples herein, but there can still be bugs in the code. If you do find any bugs, on the right sidebar, there is some text that says **Edit this page**. Click on it to go to the Github repository where you can open a pull request. Thank you.

### CSS Styling

This section does not dwell on CSS styling. However, some example use custom CSS classes, and others use TailwindCSS classes. Of course, styling is completely up to you, and you should use what you are comfortable with.

### Extra hooks

This section contains other hooks that are not part of the React Library, but are part of an external library such as React Router, or a framework such as NextJs. For such hooks, you will see a card in blue (such as this on you are reading) at the top of the page describing exactly where you can get the hook.
