# Useful Documentation For You

As much as it would be a great idea to have all resources in one place, it is almost practically impossible. There's no one single course or documentation that is self-exhaustive.

You will always find yourself having to Google, do a lot of research, and ask questions in order to fully understand something. That is the beauty of learning, that we all need to embrace in order to grow.

Therefore, below are some resources that you will find helpful in your journey to become a MASTER BUILDER.

1. [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)
   - Contains extensive documentation about web development.
2. [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
   - Contains documentation about many programming languages.
3. [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Everyone's favorite place to host their source code.
4. [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io)
   - Contains real-word examples of websites that you can attempt to code.
5. Other people's code
   - So that you get used to reading code, and understanding different programming styles.

There are definitely plenty other ways to learn such as Online course platforms and YouTube. So keep that in mind if theory-based learning isn't for you, and you prefer a more hands-on approach.
