# CSS Pseudo Elements

<Callout>This page is under construction</Callout>

A pseudo element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element or elements. It has the syntax:

```css
selector::pseudo-selector {
  property: value;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Pseudo elements are distinguished from Pseudo classes by their double colon. However, browsers currently support the single colon syntax for the original four pseudo elements namely: `::before`, `::after`, `::first-line` and `::first-letter`.
</Callout>

## `::after`
This creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. It is usually used to add some content after the element alongside the `content` property.

**Example:**
```css
a::after {
  content: "url(https://url-to-some-image.png)",
}
```

If the `content` property is not defined, or has "normal" or "none" as a value, then the `::after` pseudo element will behave as though it is set to `display: none` and will not be rendered.

## `::before`
This creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is usually used to add some content before the element alongside the `content` property.

**Example:**
```css
a::before {
  content: "url(https://url-to-some-image.png)",
}
```

If the `content` property is not defined, or has "normal" or "none" as a value, then the `::after` pseudo element will behave as though it is set to `display: none` and will not be rendered.
