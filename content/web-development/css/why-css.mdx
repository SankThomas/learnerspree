# Why Use CSS?

CSS is a powerful language of the web because it drastically improves the look and feel of your website.

Using just CSS, without adding a single line of JavaScript, you can add beautiful animations to your websites. You can even add interactivity to your website, and create amazing projects.

Check out:

1. [A Single Div](https://a.singlediv.com)
   - This website contains amazing CSS gradients which are all created using one single HTML `div` element.
2. [John Doe Neocities](https://john-doe.neocities.org/)
   - This entire website is contained within a single HTML file - even though it behaves as though it has multiple page files. All this is possible using just HTML and CSS!

The websites above do not use any JavaScript for their interactivity. That's how powerful CSS can be.

So, why use CSS?
